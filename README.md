**Project Name:** Voice-Activated Personal Assistant

**Description:**
This Python-based Voice-Activated Personal Assistant performs tasks like Wikipedia searches, opening websites, and interacting with Spotify. Users can control it through voice commands. The assistant leverages various libraries such as pyttsx3, speech_recognition, and webbrowser.

**Usage:**
1. Run the script.
2. Interact with the assistant using voice commands.
3. Examples: "Open YouTube," "Search Wikipedia for Albert Einstein," "Play song," "Stop."

**Further Scope:**
1. **Advanced Spotify Control:** Implement Spotify API integration for full music control.
2. **Email Automation:** Enable sending and reading emails.
3. **Smart Home Integration:** Control smart devices.
4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Improve understanding complex queries.
5. **Machine Learning:** Personalize responses based on user behavior.

**AI API Integration:**
By integrating AI APIs, such as natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models, this project can enhance user interaction. AI can understand context, improve speech recognition accuracy, and predict user preferences, making the assistant more intuitive and efficient. For instance, AI can suggest relevant Spotify songs based on user preferences, improving the music experience.
